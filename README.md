# DependencyInjectionDemo
C# WPF Application that utilizes Late Binding for a demonstration of Dependency Injection and the use of a CacheReader set to cache the data read every 30 seconds.
The WPF displays a list of Persons color with their Rating and the Year they started working. The backgrounds are color coded by their Rating value through the use of converters.

## Web Services 
Utilizes the MVC Pattern, withouth the View since it only calls the GET action on the API.

## Readers
- CacheReader 
- XMLReader  (XML File)
- ServiceReader (Web Service)
- SQLReader  (SQLite)
- CSVReader  (Text File)

## Unit Tests
